### Introduction

The video game industry has seen a growing trend of remakes and remasters, driven by nostalgia, improved hardware, and renewed interest in classic titles. However, not all remasters achieve the same level of success. This project aims to understand what factors contribute to a successful retro video game remaster by comparing remastered games with their original releases. The insights gathered from the project would identify what features of retro games would best predict successful ports, leading to decisions on which retro games to port next for studios.
